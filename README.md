# JavaFX
You’ve noticed that Wordle has been all the craze these days, so you decide to create your own version focusing on Java and OOP terms—Jordle!
However, entering words into a console is no fun.
Luckily, you’ve recently learned JavaFX! What a perfect opportunity to create a GUI application using various UI controls, layout management, and UI event handling.
For this homework, there will be a few basic requirements, but the UI and design of the game is largely up to you!
Feel free to explore some fun aspects of JavaFX.

Essentially, the user has 6 tries to guess a 5-letter word. For each guess the user makes, the letters will either appear green (correct letter in the correct place), yellow (correct letter in the wrong place), or grey (wrong letter in the wrong place).
The goal is to guess the word correctly.
